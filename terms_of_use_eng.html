                    complete the use of the Services in accordance with an accurate procedure.

                    the Company shall demand that such a user provide his/her valid personal
                    information that is the same as the information used when subscribing to
                    the Services. The Company shall also proceed with checking such information.
                    Otherwise, the Company has the right to refuse such a user’s request as above.
                    If the Company has verified that the information provided by such a user is
                    the same as the information provided at the time of subscription to the
                    Services, then the Company shall take prompt action and temporarily
                    suspend the log-in and use of the User Account.

                    A user shall bear any losses and consequences that occur as a result
                    of his/her voluntary leakage of the User Account or of others’ acts,
                    such as attack and fraud. The Company shall be not liable for such
                    loss and consequences, and such a user shall demand that any party
                    committing unlawful acts make reparation through legal
                    and administrative remedies.

                    or sale of without complying with the prescribed procedures nor share the User
                    Accounts with others. The acts committed through the User Accounts
                    (including but not limited to the execution of all kinds of agreements
                    online, presentations, goods and services purchases, and information
                    disclosures) shall be deemed to have been committed by the users themselves.
                    Therefore, the users shall be liable for all acts that have been committed
                    through the User Accounts and the consequences of the acts. If the User
                    Account has been used without being authorized, then users shall prevent
                    further losses and severe consequences by immediately notifying the Company.
                    If the Company determines that the use of the User Account poses a danger
                    to the security of the User Account and/or data on the Services, then the
                    Company may refuse to render corresponding services or
                    terminate these Terms of Use.

                    Users may transfer the User Account only in the presence of a clear legal
                    provision, a court’s decision, or the Company’s consent and in compliance
                    with the procedure for transferring the User Account as stipulated in the
                    Service Rules. The transfer of the User Account shall entail the transfer
                    of rights and obligations conferred on the User Account. Except for the
                    foregoing case, in no way shall the User Account be transferred. Users
                    shall bear all liability arising out of the unpermitted
                    transfer of the User Accounts.

                  <li class="mb-2">
                    If a user has not logged on to the User Account for six (6) consecutive months,
                    then the Company has the right to take actions to clear the Account,
                    including cancellation, recovery, replacement, or deletion of all
                    records on the User Account (including but not limited to information
                    required for subscription and information on virtual futures) in the
                    database. As a result of this, the User Account might be incapable of
                    logging in to any service rendered by the Company, and existing information
                    will likely be prohibited from being used or deleted. The Company shall
                    inform users of the User Account clearance by methods, including but not
                    limited to pop-up messages, announcements or messages within websites,
                    and information in push alerts for clients, prior to the conduct of such clearance.
